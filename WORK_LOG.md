| October 25 | 2:30 - 3:00 pm |                                                                                        I brainstormed possible solutions. I debated about using an array of arraylists, or vice versa. I thought abut storing collisions in their own array/arraylist. |
| October 26 | 3:30 - 4:00pm  |                                                I researched how to convert the hash function to an index inner table (bucket). I copied Horner's method from DNA code. I used the technique from Sedgewick to use modulo bucket size to get the index. |

| October 26 | 5:00 - 5:30pm  | I tested the code. I printed out all the index values for given keys. I did this to see if they were distributed properly. I fixed the error in comparing two strings (using .equals() worked correctly in contrast to ==). All tests started to pass. |
